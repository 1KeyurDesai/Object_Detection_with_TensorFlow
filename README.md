# Object Detection with TensorFlow 📦

This project applies object detection using TensorFlow with transfer learning.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Python
- Pretrained detection model

## ✅ Features
- Bounding box detection on images
- Transfer learning from pre-trained SSD model
- Simple implementation & training

## 🚀 How to Run
Run the `Object_Detection_with_TensorFlow.ipynb` notebook.

## 📈 Results
Trained on a custom dataset, model detects multiple object types effectively.
